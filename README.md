# Project-Prometheus
Project Prometheus is a 15-month journey, culminating on June 1st, 2025, to master AI, automation, and software/hardware development from the ground up. By blending CS, mathematics, and hands-on projects, Iâ€™ll build a self-sufficient foundation for real-world solutions. This repo documents each step and showcases my progress.
